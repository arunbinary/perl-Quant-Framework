=head1 NAME

Quant::Framework::CorporateAction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the corporate actions data of an underlying from database. Create
new unpersistent CorporateAction can be done via:

 my $ca = Quant::Framework::CorporateAction::create($storage_accessor, 'QWER', Date::Utility->new);

Obviously, it will have empty actions hash

 $ca->actions; # empty hashref by default

Corporate actions can be persisted (stored in Chronicle) via C<save> method

 $ca->save;

Load persisted actions can be done via:

 my $ca = Quant::Framework::CorporateAction::load($storage_accessor, 'QWER', Date::Utility->new);

It will return C<undef> if there are no presisted actions in Chronicle. The date can be
ommitted, than, it will try to load the most recent (last) corporate actions, i.e.

 my $ca = Quant::Framework::CorporateAction::load($storage_accessor, 'QWER');


To update actions, the C<update> method should be invoked, with appropriate structure, i.e.

 my $ca = $ca->update({
   "62799500" => {
      "monitor_date" => "2014-02-07T06:00:07Z",
      "type" => "ACQUIS",
      "monitor" => 1,
      "description" =>  "Acquisition",
      "effective_date" =>  "15-Jul-14",
      "flag" => "N",
 }, Date::Utility->new);

The C<update> in scalar context will return B<new unpersisted> Corporate object. You have
to presist it via C<save> method.

In the list context it will return new unpersisted Corporate object, and two hasref for
new and cancelled action.

    },
 }, Date::Utility->new)
 $new_corp_actions->save;

Takes the existing actions, applies "diff" of actions in Bloomberg
format (i.e. adds new actions, or cancels exising ones), and
returns new unpersisted (non-saved) CorporateAction object.

You have to invoke C<save> method to persist new corporate actions
in Chronicle.

The C<$date> argument in mandatory.
