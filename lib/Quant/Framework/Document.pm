=head1 NAME

Quant::Framework::Document - Role, which binds data with Chronicle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The class is responsible for Create, Loading and Save Q::F Objects via Data::Chronicle.
The data itself is a hash, which content is provided by users of the class (i.e. by
CorporateActions).

The role provides C<load> (C<load_default>), C<create> (C<create_default>) and C<save>
methods. The C<*_default> varians are provided with the intention to allow override
the original methods with possibility still to use the default impementation. This
might be needed to specialized symbol-less objects like Holiday.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 storage_accessor

Chronicle assessor

=head2 recorded_date

The date of document creation (C<Date::Utility>)

=head2 data

Hashref of data. Should be defined by the class, which uses Document. Currently the fields
C<date> and C<symbol> are reserved.


=head2 symbol

The domain-specific name of document; e.g. "USAAPL" for corporate actions

=head2 namespace

=head1 REQUIED METHODS

=head2 namespace()

returns namespace (strign) for the object, which the role is applied to,
e.g. "corporate_actions" or "holidays"

=head2 initialize_data()

Returns initialized hash ref for data.  For example for Holidays, it can
be C<{ calendar => {} }>. The fields C<symbol> and C<date> are reserved,
please, do not fill them.

=cut

requires 'namespace';

requires 'initialize_data';

=head1 METHODS

=head2 create($package, $storage_accessor, $symbol, $for_date)

=head2 create_default($package, $storage_accessor, $symbol, $for_date)


Creates new unsaved (non-persisted) object, to which the role is applied
to. The C<create> can be overriden, while The C<create_default> not.
They have the same impelemtation.


  Quant::Framework::CorporateAction->create($storage_accessor, 'USAAPL', $date);

Please note, it should be invoked with package name (the module, to which the
role is applied to), otherwise it will not work.

All paremeters are required


=head2 load($package, $storage_accessor, $symbol, $for_date)

=head2 load_default($package, $storage_accessor, $symbol, $for_date)

Loads persiseted object. All paramters are mandatory, except
C<$for_date> which is optional. If C<$for_date> is not specified,
it loads the last stored object.

In case, when object does not exist, it returns C<undef>.

The C<load> can be overriden, while The C<load_default> not.
They have the same impelemtation.


  Quant::Framework::CorporateAction->load($storage_accessor, 'QWER')

Please note, it should be invoked with package name (the module, to which the
role is applied to), otherwise it will not work.
